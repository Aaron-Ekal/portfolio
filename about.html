            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sub_heady">Aaron Ekal is a down to earth and a loving human being. His background in computer and
            playing videogames is the thriving force that steered him to start coding. The fact that anyone can code and
            that it's not for the chosen few is what drives him to click one button at a time every single day. <br>

            Ekal's hunger for knowledge and determination to turn hardwork into action contributed to him being an
            Employee of the month five consecutive months in VIVO Smartphone Kenya, where he led a group of 18 promoters
            to achieve their monthly sales target and thus beating competitors such as Oppo, Samsung, techno and Infinix
            in his region. Morever, he vastly improved the productivity of his team by implementing strategic key
            selling methods and ensuring a work-life balance in his work <br>

            Ekal believes mindfulness in the workplace is key to success - a tenet he lives out through his interests in
            Coding,
            playing basketball, gardening, and solving problems. Ekal is currently learning web development at Moringa
            school because he wants to achieve his long awaited career in tech as a Software Developer!.</div>
